# Collaborative Case-Study-Based Learning Module for the 21 Nursing Problems

## Purpose
This repository serves as a structured educational resource where nursing students can apply **Faye Abdellah's 21 Nursing Problems theory** to a realistic patient case study. The module demonstrates a complete workflow from assignment to feedback to final publication, fostering the development of professional nursing attitudes, intellectual competencies, and technical skills.

## Introduction to the 21 Nursing Problems
Faye Abdellah’s theory identifies 21 fundamental nursing problems that represent the core of patient‑centered care. These problems are not medical diagnoses but areas of human need that nurses must address to deliver holistic care. The 21 problems encompass physical, emotional, social, and environmental dimensions, guiding nurses to view the patient as a whole person.

The 21 Nursing Problems are:
1. To maintain good hygiene and physical comfort.
2. To promote optimal activity: exercise, rest, and sleep.
3. To promote safety through prevention of accident, injury, or other trauma and through the prevention of the spread of infection.
4. To maintain good body mechanics and prevent and correct deformities.
5. To facilitate the maintenance of a supply of oxygen to all body cells.
6. To facilitate the maintenance of nutrition of all body cells.
7. To facilitate the maintenance of elimination.
8. To facilitate the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance.
9. To recognize the physiological responses of the body to disease conditions—pathological, physiological, and compensatory.
10. To facilitate the maintenance of regulatory mechanisms and functions.
11. To facilitate the maintenance of sensory function.
12. To identify and accept positive and negative expressions, feelings, and reactions.
13. To identify and accept the interrelatedness of emotions and organic illness.
14. To facilitate the maintenance of effective verbal and non‑verbal communication.
15. To promote the development of productive interpersonal relationships.
16. To facilitate progress toward achievement of personal spiritual goals.
17. To create and/or maintain a therapeutic environment.
18. To facilitate awareness of self as an individual with varying physical, emotional, and developmental needs.
19. To accept the optimum possible goals in the light of physical and emotional limitations.
20. To use community resources as an aid in resolving problems arising from illness.
21. To understand the role of social problems as influencing factors in the cause of illness.

## How to Participate
1. **Review the patient case study** – Read `Patient_Case_History.md` for a detailed, de‑identified scenario of an elderly patient post‑surgery with comorbidities.
2. **Choose an assigned problem** – Each student or group will be assigned one of the 21 nursing problems via a GitHub Issue.
3. **Create your analysis** – In the `submissions/` directory, create a new file named `[Problem_Number]_Analysis.md` (e.g., `01_Analysis.md`) that examines the patient through the lens of your assigned problem.
4. **Work on a branch** – Create a new branch (e.g., `problem-1-analysis`) and commit your analysis there.
5. **Submit a Pull Request** – Open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch. The PR title should reference the issue number (e.g., “Analysis for Problem #1: To Maintain Good Hygiene”).
6. **Receive feedback** – The instructor (Faye Abdellah) will review your PR, provide inline comments, and may request changes to refine your application of the theory.
7. **Revise and merge** – Once your analysis meets the standards, it will be merged into the main repository.

## Repository Structure
- `README.md` – This file.
- `Patient_Case_History.md` – The detailed patient scenario.
- `submissions/` – Directory where students place their analysis files (created as part of the workflow).
- `issues/` – (Optional) Folder for archived issue templates.
- `.github/` – (Optional) GitHub workflow and issue templates.

## Final Goal
After all 21 problem analyses have been completed, reviewed, and merged, a final GitHub Release will be published (v1.0). This release will serve as a permanent, versioned educational artifact that can be used as a reference or example for future nursing cohorts.
