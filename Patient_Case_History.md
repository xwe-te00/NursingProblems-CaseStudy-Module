## Presenting Complaint
Mr. Wilson was admitted to the hospital after a fall at home resulting in a right hip fracture. He underwent a right total hip arthroplasty (THA) three days ago.

## Past Medical History
1. **Hypertension** – diagnosed 15 years ago, currently managed with lisinopril 10 mg daily.
2. **Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus** – diagnosed 10 years ago, managed with metformin 500 mg twice daily and diet control. Recent HbA1c 7.2%.
3. **Osteoarthritis** – bilateral knees, symptomatic for which he takes acetaminophen as needed.
4. **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)** – causes nocturia (2–3 times per night) and occasional urgency.
5. **Mild Cognitive Impairment** – noticeable short‑term memory lapses but independent in ADLs.

## Surgical History
- Appendectomy (age 22)
- Cataract surgery (right eye, 5 years ago)

## Social History
- **Smoking:** Former smoker, quit 20 years ago (30 pack‑year history).
- **Alcohol:** Occasional glass of wine with dinner (≈1–2 units per week).
- **Diet:** Generally balanced but high in carbohydrates; recent poor appetite post‑surgery.
- **Mobility:** Before the fall, used a cane for long walks due to knee pain. Now non‑weight‑bearing on right lower extremity.
- **Support System:** Daughter visits weekly, but Mr. Wilson values his independence and is reluctant to ask for help.

## Current Hospital Course
**Post‑operative Day 3** – Mr. Wilson is on the orthopedic ward. Vital signs are stable: BP 145/88 mmHg, HR 92 bpm, RR 18, SpO₂ 94% on room air, temperature 37.8°C (oral). He reports moderate pain at the surgical site (rated 6/10) despite scheduled acetaminophen and occasional oxycodone. The incision is clean, dry, and intact with mild erythema; no signs of infection.

## Key Assessment Findings
### Physical
- **Skin:** Dry, thin skin with several senile purpura on forearms. No pressure ulcers noted; he is repositioned every 2 hours.
- **Respiratory:** Breath sounds clear bilaterally, but cough is weak and non‑productive. He is reluctant to use incentive spirometer due to pain.
- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rhythm, no murmurs. Mild pedal edema (1+) bilaterally.
- **Gastrointestinal:** Abdomen soft, non‑tender. Bowel sounds present. Last bowel movement 2 days ago; he reports feeling “bloated.”
- **Genitourinary:** Urine output adequate (>0.5 mL/kg/h). Urinalysis shows trace leukocytes, but no symptoms of UTI. BPH symptoms persist.
- **Musculoskeletal:** Right hip dressing intact. Right leg in neutral alignment. He has been instructed to maintain hip precautions (no flexion >90°, no adduction, no internal rotation).
- **Neurological:** Alert and oriented to person, place, and time. Short‑term memory deficits noted (e.g., forgets nurse’s name shortly after introduction). He expresses frustration about “not being as sharp as before.”

### Psychosocial
- **Emotional State:** Anxious about his ability to return home alone. He states, “I don’t want to be a burden to my children.”
- **Coping:** Uses humor to deflect concerns; reluctant to discuss fears openly.
- **Spiritual:** Identifies as Protestant but has not attended church regularly since his wife’s death two years ago. He finds comfort in reading the Bible.
- **Financial Concerns:** Fixed income; worried about cost of home modifications (e.g., stair lift) and possible need for paid caregiver.

## Medications (Current)
1. Lisinopril 10 mg PO daily
2. Metformin 500 mg PO twice daily
3. Acetaminophen 650 mg PO every 6 hours (scheduled)
4. Oxycodone 5 mg PO every 4 hours as needed for pain (used twice in last 24 hours)
5. Docusate sodium 100 mg PO twice daily (for constipation prevention)
6. Enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously daily (DVT prophylaxis)

## Nursing Concerns & Collaborative Problems
- **Pain Management:** Inadequate pain control may impede mobility and participation in physical therapy.
- **Mobility & Safety:** High risk for falls, non‑weight‑bearing status, need for assistive devices and education on hip precautions.
- **Infection Prevention:** Surgical site monitoring, aseptic technique, and prevention of hospital‑acquired infections (pneumonia, UTI).
- **Nutrition & Hydration:** Poor appetite, diabetic diet requirements, risk of dehydration.
- **Elimination:** Constipation risk from opioids, BPH‑related urinary symptoms.
- **Psychosocial Support:** Anxiety, fear of dependency, grief from loss of spouse, mild cognitive impairment affecting comprehension and recall.
- **Discharge Planning:** Need for home health services, equipment, family education, and follow‑up appointments.

## Learning Objectives for Students
This case is designed to be complex enough to allow application of **multiple nursing problems**. Students should:
1. Identify which of Abdellah’s 21 nursing problems are most relevant to Mr. Wilson’s situation.
2. Prioritize the problems based on immediacy and potential impact on recovery.
3. Develop specific nursing interventions that address each problem within the context of the case.
4. Reflect on how the interplay of physical, emotional, social, and environmental factors influences care planning.
