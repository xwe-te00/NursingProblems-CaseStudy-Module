# Submissions Directory

This directory will contain students' analysis files for each of the 21 nursing problems.

## Naming Convention
Files should be named `[Problem_Number]_Analysis.md`, where `Problem_Number` is a two‑digit number (01–21) corresponding to the order of the nursing problems listed in the main README.

## Example
`01_Analysis.md` – Analysis for "To maintain good hygiene and physical comfort"

## Workflow
1. Each student/group creates their analysis file in this directory on a separate branch.
2. After completing the analysis, they open a Pull Request to merge their branch into `main`.
3. The instructor reviews the PR, provides feedback, and merges the file once it meets the standards.
